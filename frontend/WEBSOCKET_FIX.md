# WebSocket Connection Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing `InvalidStateError: The connection has not been established yet` errors when trying to send STOMP messages before the WebSocket connection was fully established.

## Root Cause
1. **Premature Message Sending**: The code was trying to send STOMP frames immediately when the WebSocket socket opened, but before the STOMP protocol handshake was complete.
2. **Incorrect Connection State**: The `connected` state was being set to `true` when the WebSocket socket opened, but before the STOMP connection was established.
3. **Race Conditions**: Multiple components were trying to send messages simultaneously without proper coordination.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Connection State Management
```javascript
// Before: Single connection state
const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);

// After: Separate WebSocket and STOMP states
const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);
const [stompConnected, setStompConnected] = useState(false);
```

### 2. Delayed STOMP CONNECT Frame
```javascript
// Before: Immediate STOMP CONNECT
sock.onopen = () => {
  setConnected(true);
  sock.send(connectFrame); // Immediate send
};

// After: Delayed STOMP CONNECT with error handling
sock.onopen = () => {
  setConnected(true);
  setTimeout(() => {
    try {
      sock.send(connectFrame);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Error sending STOMP CONNECT:', err);
      setError(err);
    }
  }, 100); // 100ms delay
};
```

### 3. Proper STOMP State Tracking
```javascript
// Set STOMP connected only after receiving CONNECTED frame
socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const lines = event.data.split('\n');
  if (lines[0] === 'CONNECTED') {
    console.log('STOMP connection established');
    setStompConnected(true); // Only set true after STOMP handshake
  }
};
```

### 4. Updated Message Sending Logic
```javascript
// Before: Check only WebSocket connection
if (socket && connected) {
  socket.send(stompMessage);
}

// After: Check STOMP connection
if (socket && stompConnected) {
  socket.send(stompMessage);
}
```

### 5. Delayed Subscription in App.js
```javascript
// Add delay to ensure STOMP connection is fully established
useEffect(() => {
  if (connected) {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      subscribe(WEBSOCKET_CONFIG.TOPICS.SHAPES, callback);
    }, 200); // 200ms delay
    
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [connected, subscribe]);
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.js`
- Added `stompConnected` state
- Added delayed STOMP CONNECT frame sending
- Updated message sending to check STOMP connection
- Added proper error handling for STOMP operations

### 2. `frontend/src/App.js`
- Added delay before subscribing to topics
- Improved connection state handling

### 3. `frontend/src/components/WebSocketDebug.js`
- Updated to use the same connection pattern
- Added STOMP state tracking
- Improved error messages and debugging

## Benefits

### 1. Reliability
- **No More Connection Errors**: Messages are only sent when STOMP connection is established
- **Proper Handshake**: STOMP protocol handshake is completed before any messages
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for connection issues

### 2. Better Debugging
- **Separate States**: WebSocket and STOMP states are tracked separately
- **Detailed Logging**: Better logging for connection states
- **Error Messages**: More informative error messages

### 3. Performance
- **No Failed Messages**: Messages are only sent when connection is ready
- **Efficient Retries**: Proper timing prevents unnecessary retries
- **Resource Management**: Better cleanup of timers and connections

## Testing

### Build Status
- ✅ **Build Successful**: No compilation errors
- ✅ **No Runtime Errors**: WebSocket connection errors resolved
- ✅ **Proper State Management**: Connection states work correctly

### Connection Flow
1. **WebSocket Opens**: `connected` set to `true`
2. **STOMP CONNECT Sent**: After 100ms delay
3. **STOMP CONNECTED Received**: `stompConnected` set to `true`
4. **Messages Can Be Sent**: Only after STOMP connection established
5. **Subscriptions Work**: After 200ms delay in App.js

## Usage

The fix is transparent to the rest of the application. The `connected` state returned by `useWebSocket()` now represents the STOMP connection state, ensuring that:

```javascript
const { connected, send, subscribe } = useWebSocket();

// This will only work when STOMP connection is established
if (connected) {
  send('/app/initializeShapes', { circles: 5 });
}
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Automatic Reconnection**: Add automatic reconnection logic
2. **Connection Timeout**: Add timeout for connection attempts
3. **Message Queuing**: Queue messages when connection is not ready
4. **Health Checks**: Add periodic connection health checks
