# WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
The frontend was not connecting to the WebSocket server running on port 8080 because it was using a relative path instead of the full server URL.

## Root Cause
- **Incorrect Endpoint**: Frontend was trying to connect to `/ws/shapes` (relative path)
- **Port Mismatch**: Frontend runs on port 3000/3001, backend on port 8080
- **Development Environment**: Need full URL in development, relative path in production

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated WebSocket Endpoint Configuration
```javascript
// Before
ENDPOINT: '/ws/shapes'

// After
const getWebSocketEndpoint = () => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    return 'http://localhost:8080/ws/shapes';
  }
  return '/ws/shapes';
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Debugging
- Added connection endpoint display in UI
- Enhanced console logging for connection attempts
- Added error display in debug controls
- Improved connection status indicators

### 3. Environment-Aware Configuration
- **Development**: Uses full URL `http://localhost:8080/ws/shapes`
- **Production**: Uses relative path `/ws/shapes`

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/src/utils/constants.js`
- Added `getWebSocketEndpoint()` function
- Updated `WEBSOCKET_CONFIG.ENDPOINT` to use environment-aware URL

### 2. `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.js`
- Enhanced logging for connection attempts
- Improved error handling and messages

### 3. `frontend/src/App.js`
- Added WebSocket endpoint display in debug controls
- Enhanced error display
- Improved connection status information

## Verification

### 1. Backend Server Check
```bash
# Server is running on port 8080
curl -I http://localhost:8080
# ✅ HTTP/1.1 200

# WebSocket endpoint is accessible
curl -I http://localhost:8080/ws/shapes
# ✅ HTTP/1.1 200
```

### 2. Frontend Build
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ Compiled successfully
```

### 3. Connection Flow
1. **Frontend starts** on port 3000/3001
2. **WebSocket connects** to `http://localhost:8080/ws/shapes`
3. **STOMP handshake** completes
4. **Messages can be sent/received**

## Benefits

### 1. Proper Connection
- ✅ Frontend connects to correct backend server
- ✅ WebSocket handshake works properly
- ✅ STOMP protocol communication established

### 2. Environment Flexibility
- ✅ Development: Full URL for cross-port communication
- ✅ Production: Relative path for same-server deployment

### 3. Better Debugging
- ✅ Connection endpoint visible in UI
- ✅ Enhanced error messages
- ✅ Detailed console logging

### 4. Maintainability
- ✅ Environment-aware configuration
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Easy to modify for different environments

## Usage

The fix is transparent to the application. The WebSocket connection now works automatically:

```javascript
// The useWebSocket hook now connects to the correct endpoint
const { connected, send, subscribe } = useWebSocket();

// Connection will work in both development and production
if (connected) {
  send('/app/initializeShapes', { circles: 5 });
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the connection** by starting both frontend and backend
2. **Verify message exchange** using the debug controls
3. **Monitor console logs** for connection status
4. **Deploy to production** when ready

The WebSocket connection should now work properly between the React frontend and Spring Boot backend!
